                <p>Now this is a story all about how</p>
                <p>My life got flipped-turned upside down</p>
                <p>And I'd like to take a minute</p>
                <p>Just sit right there</p>
                <p>I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>
                <br>
                <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised</p>
                <p>On the playground was where I spent most of my days</p>
                <p>Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool</p>
                <p>And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school</p>
                <p>When a couple of guys who were up to no good</p>
                <p>Started making trouble in my neighborhood</p>
                <p>I got in one little fight and my mom got scared</p>
                <p>She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."</p>
                <br>
                <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near</p>
                <p>The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror</p>
                <p>If anything I could say that this cab was rare</p>
                <p>But I thought, "Nah, forget it."</p>
                <p>â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air."</p>
                <br>
                <p>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8</p>
                <p>And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."</p>
                <p>I looked at my kingdom</p>
                <p>I was finally there</p>
                <p>To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air</p>
